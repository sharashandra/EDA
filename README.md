Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data analysis process. It involves examining and visualizing data to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions. The goal of EDA is to gain insights and understand the underlying structure of the data before applying more complex modeling techniques.

1. Understand the Data:

Data Types: Identify the types of variables (numerical, categorical, ordinal, etc.).
Data Structure: Check the dimensions of the dataset, data types of each column, and the basic summary statistics.

Sample Code:
Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
Basic understanding
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())
print(df.head())

2. Data Cleaning:
   
Handle Missing Values: Identify and manage missing data through imputation, deletion, or interpolation.
Remove Duplicates: Ensure there are no duplicate records.
Correct Data Types: Convert data types where necessary.

Sample Code:
 Handle missing value
df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)  # Example for numerical columns
 Remove duplicates
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
 Convert data types
df['column_name'] = df['column_name'].astype('int')

3. Univariate Analysis:
   
Analyze the distribution of individual variables using histograms, box plots, and summary statistics.
Numerical Variables: Look at measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation).
Categorical Variables: Examine frequency distributions and use bar plots.

Sample Code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
Numerical variable
sns.histplot(df['numerical_column'], kde=True)
plt.show()
Categorical variable
sns.countplot(x='categorical_column', data=df)
plt.show()

4. Bivariate Analysis:

Explore relationships between two variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and cross-tabulations.
Numerical vs. Numerical: Scatter plots and correlation analysis.
Numerical vs. Categorical: Box plots and group comparisons.

Sample Code:
Scatter plot
sns.scatterplot(x='numerical_column1', y='numerical_column2', data=df)
plt.show()
Correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()

5. Multivariate Analysis:

Examine interactions among multiple variables using techniques like pair plots, clustering, and PCA.
Pair Plots: Visualize relationships between several pairs of variables.
PCA: Reduce dimensionality for complex datasets.

Sample Code:
Pair plot
sns.pairplot(df)
plt.show()

6. Handling Outliers:

Identify and manage outliers using box plots, Z-scores, or IQR methods.

Sample Code:
Identify outliers using IQR
Q1 = df['numerical_column'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['numerical_column'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1

outliers = df[(df['numerical_column'] < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (df['numerical_column'] > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))]
print(outliers)

7. Feature Engineering:

Create new features from existing ones to enhance the model's performance.
Example: Binning, polynomial features, interaction terms.

Sample Code:
Create a new feature
df['new_feature'] = df['existing_feature1'] * df['existing_feature2']

8. Visualization Tools:
   
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Plotly: For creating interactive graphs.
Pandas Plotting: Simple and quick plotting with pandas built-in capabilities.
